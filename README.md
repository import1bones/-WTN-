**tip:** this application can work,some explanatory note is chinese,can't display in github,some explanatory note is my mind when i program this application.this applaction need 10-20s to start.
## about
- this project was used in a  machine game
- about this kind of game you can know about by search **EinStein würfelt nicht!** in wiki,it rule is simple.
## -Environmental configuration-
- x64,memory is bigger than 4G.
- Easyx

- TensorFlow2.0
## -User Instructions-
if you have know about this game's rule,we will show you how to use this application.  
## -Feature-
- MCST
- Machine-Learning
- An intergration of MCST and Machine-Learning.
## -Now-
- RandomList can't be used.
- dataset is too few,dataset only include uct vs uct,if vs decision tree,always be beat.
## -Disadvantage-
- Don't support multi-thread.
- GUI is not user friendly.
- This application is inefficiency,maybe reason is using c/python api to make an intergeration of MCST and Machine-learning.
- Can't output dataset.
- Not make Memory recovery，but don't effect working.
