# -WTN-
this application can work.
## -Environmental configuration-
- Python3.7.4
- TensorFlow2.0
## -Feature-
- MCST
- Machine-Learning
- An intergration of MCST and Machine-Learning
## -Now-
1. RandomList can't be used.
2. dataset is too few,dataset only include uct vs uct,if vs decision tree,always be beat.
## -Disadvantage-
- Don't support multi-thread
- GUI is not user friendly
- This application is inefficiency,maybe reason is using c/python api to make an intergeration of MCST and Machine-learning
